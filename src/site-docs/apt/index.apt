Maven Project Parent POM

    This POM is the common parent of all of the Maven components
    in the Apache Maven project. Most of its contents are
    pinning down version numbers of plugins; it does not 
    provide any dependencyManagement.

    This POM contains Maven developers information for the {{{./team-list.html}Project Team report}},
    sorted by role and id.
    See the LDAP extract for more accurate {{{http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#maven}committers}}
    and {{{http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#maven-pmc}PMC members}} lists. 

The <<<reporting>>> Profile

    This POM provides <<<reporting>>> profile for rendering documentation during site generation:

+---
mvn -Preporting site
mvn -Preporting site-deploy
+---

    See {{{./plugins.html}Plugins report}} for a list of configured report plugins.

The <<<apache.shapshots>>> Profile

    An <<<apache.shapshots>>> profile is provided to activate Apache Snapshot repository when necessary, for
    example in a CI server.

History

    As of version 21, this POM sets the Java source and target versions to 1.5. Thus, as any plugin (or other component)
    moved to version 21+ of this POM, it moves to requiring Java 1.5.
